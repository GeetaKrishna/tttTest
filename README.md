## Components

* Server
    * An API, `/api` is created with help of express library. This api is responsible to get the frequency details(N) and do all the necessary operations to find the top N most words present in the string generated by accessing [`given URL`](http://terriblytinytales.com/test.txt)
    * splitByWords() splits the string(obtained after making remote call to [`given URL`](http://terriblytinytales.com/test.txt)) and returns an array of words .
    * createWordMap(N, wordsArray) takes in the frequency number and the array of words, gets the count of each word.
    * After grouping the words with same frequency we use getUnique(arr, comp) to remove duplicate entries if any.
    * Later splice the array to send only the top N most words in the text file/string.

* Client
    * The main app Component loads the selector <app-root> 
    * `app.component.ts` is responsible for all the logical code.
    * This file has a function apiCall() which inturn has the logic to subscribe HttpClient to access the API `/api` and send the frequency details (N) to server.
    * the HTTPClient is injected upon importing from angular/common/http
    * `app-routing.module.ts` contains the route details of each component, it provides a uri to access the component/page.
